Abstract
________

In this report I going to forecast the performance barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. I doing the forecast using Practical Machine Learning, I use data by http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har, that contains classe variable (variable to predict) and serveral predictors variables that no necessary are the predictors. This report has 4 sections. The first one is the code to download the training and testing data, and upload the packages that I will use in this report; the second section I will do cleaning of data; the third section has the brief exploratory analysis; the fourth section shows the several models that I going to estimate and the respective analysis and the last one section I make the mains conclusions.
